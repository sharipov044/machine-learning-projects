# Machine Learning Project: Iris Flower Classification with Random Forest

This repository contains a machine learning project that demonstrates how to classify Iris flowers based on their features using the Random Forest Classifier. The project uses the famous Iris dataset, which is a beginner-friendly dataset commonly used for practicing classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. We'll explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train a Random Forest Classifier, evaluate its performance, and finally, provide insights and conclusions.

## Dataset Description

The Iris dataset is available in the `sklearn.datasets` module from the scikit-learn library. It contains 150 instances, with each instance having four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).

## Project Structure

The project's directory structure is as follows:

|- iris_classification.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with the entire project code
|- README.md # Project README file (you are reading it)
|- requirements.txt # List of required Python libraries


## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/sharipov044/machine-learning-projects/iris-flower-classification.git
cd machine-learning-projects
cd iris-flower-classification


2. Install the Required Libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook iris-flower-classification.ipynb


4. Follow the Notebook:

The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed explanations and code for each step of the project, including data exploration, data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and conclusion. Execute each cell in the Notebook sequentially to see the results and visualizations.

## Results and Insights

The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 96.67% on the test set, indicating good performance in classifying Iris flowers. The confusion matrix and classification report provide additional insights into the model's precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow for classifying Iris flowers using the Random Forest algorithm. It's a great starting point for those new to machine learning and provides valuable hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and experiment with other algorithms and techniques to improve the model's performance.
